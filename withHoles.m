%% withHoles
% modify a 1D kernel (eg B3-spline) for use in the "รก trous wavelet transform"

%% Description
% Given the 1D kernel [1 2 3 2 1], for a scale level (j) insert 2^(j-1)-1 zeros between
% the taps in the the kernel. For example:
%
% For j=2, [1 2 3 2 1] becomes [1 0 2 0 3 0 2 0 1]   
%
% For j=3, [1 2 3 2 1] becomes [1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1]   

%% Input
% * *|kernel|* - a 1D kernel that will have "รก trous" applied to it
%
% * *|scaleLevel|* - an integer that specifies how to modify |kernel|, see description

%% Output
% * *|kernel|* - the modified kernel, still 1D
